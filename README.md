# Cyberbullying-Detection

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>Cyberbullying Warning System</strong> is an AI-driven solution designed to detect and address cyberbullying in online communications. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), this system analyzes text inputs for toxicity and harassment indicators, providing proactive warnings to users.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Cyberbullying has become a significant concern in the digital age, leading to emotional distress and psychological harm. This project aims to mitigate such effects by identifying harmful content and alerting users before it spreads.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automated Text Analysis:</strong> Uses NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and sentiment analysis to process textual data.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify text based on toxicity levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Active Learning Approach:</strong> Enhances dataset quality dynamically through iterative labeling and annotation.</li>
    <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Integrates with MS Excel and Tableau for intuitive content analysis and visualization.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Accuracy:</strong> Achieved a <strong>30% accuracy improvement</strong> over baseline models through hyperparameter tuning and model selection.</li>
</ul>
